module Apriori

  # This class represents a single association rule.
  # 
  # From Christian's original documentation: 
  # 
  # An association rule is a rule like "If a customer buys wine and bread, he often
  # buys cheese, too."
  # 
  # An association rule states that if we pick a customer at random and find out
  # that he selected certain items (bought certain products, chose certain options
  # etc.), we can be confident, quantified by a percentage, that he also selected
  # certain other items (bought certain other products, chose certain other options
  # etc.).
